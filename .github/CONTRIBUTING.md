## How to contribute to nZEDb

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/nZEDb/nZEDb/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/nZEDb/nZEDb/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

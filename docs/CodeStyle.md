#nZEDb Code Style

nZEDb uses a code style based on Lithium's [LSR-0](http://li3.me/docs/specs/accepted/LSR-0-coding.md),
with a few modifications for features that have been releases since PHP 5.3, or that are not
mentioned in it at all.

For PHP Storm users there is a [settings.jar](https://github.com/Howard3/Lithium_PhpStorm) file
which has these behaviours mostly predefined. The settings uses a dark theme, but this can be
overridden to use whichever theme you like.


##Changes
* Namespace declarations should follow our license header/comments, if they exist.
* Protected fields/methods are NOT preceded by an underscore. - This makes refactoring easier.
* Functions/methods have the opening brace (curly bracket) on a new line.
* Functions/methods should have one blank line before any return statement.


##Additions
* Array short form syntax should be used.

### Class anatomy
1. Class head.
2. Constants, preferably in alphabetical order for easier finding of individual entries.
3. Fields (variables). Ordered, by visibility (public, protected, private), and then preferably in
  alphabetical order for easier finding of individual entries.
4. Methods (functions). Ordered as fields above.

### Database
* Table names should be pluralised nouns that reflect the row content.
  i.e. releases - each row is data for one release
* Tables with a one-to-many relationship should use the singular 'one' table's name, with the
 pluralised 'many' tables name, separated by an underscore.
  i.e. video_aliases - each video (from videos) can have more than one alias
* Tables that are a join table for many-to-many relationships have both tables pluralised.
  i.e users_releases contains rows for users and their releases.
* Table aliases should be an initialised version of the table's name. It is preferabe to separate
 the alias from the table name with 'AS'. This reduces errors caused by missed commas and makes the
 intent explicit.
  i.e. release_naming_regexes AS rnr


* Fields referencing fields in other tables (usually indexed fields), should use the table name
 followed by the field name separated by an underderscore.
  i.e. videos_id is a reference to videos.id (the id field in the videos table).
